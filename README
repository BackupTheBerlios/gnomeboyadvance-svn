Configuration of keys
=====================
all numbers are in hexadecimal!
Keys values are in the format YXXX where Y is the device number. 0 means
keyborad and XXX is the SDL define for the desired key (read SDL_keysym.h).

If Y is greater than 0, it means joystick number Y-1 and it uses the
following format for XXX:

- if XXX < 20, XXX is the axis number multiplied by 2. An even number means
  movement to the negative side (on the X axis, it means left). An odd
  number means movement to the positive side (on the X axis, it mean
  right). For the Y axis, negative means up and positive means down.
  X axis is usally axis number 0 and Y is axis number 1.
- if 20 >= XXX > 30, then XXX is the HAT number multiplied by 4 plus the
  direction: 0 for up, 1 for down, 2 for right and 3 for left. Example:
  0021 is HAT 0 down, 0026 is HAT 1 right.
- if 80 >= XXX > 100, XXX is the joystick button number (XXX-080).

Default key configuration is (value in parenthesis):

Left          Left Arrow  (0114)
Right         Right Arrow (0113)
Up            Up Arrow    (0111)
Down          Down Arrow  (0112)
A             Q
B             S
L             A           (0061)
R             Z
Start         ENTER       (000d)
Select        BACKSPACE   (0008)
Speed up      SPACE       (0020)
Capture       F12         (0125)

It will be improved in the next release!
