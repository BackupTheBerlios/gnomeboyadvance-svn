The futur of GnomeBoyAdvance
============================
Since the 1.7.2 version, VisualBoyAdvance contains a graphic interface in GTK.
So we're reconsidering the interest and goals of GnomeBoyAdvance, since we don't want to produce 
useless work by developing a program that nobody is using or wanting. 
And we would be glad to hear your thoughts about that.
How do You envisage the future of GnomeBoyAdvance :
- a better GNOME integration? 
- a program more centered on the gestion of your roms collection?
- something completely different? 
- or perhaps you think GBA is now condemned to death? 
Please send us your opinion on the project's forum or by mail cass@skynet.be
Thanks
